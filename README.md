## How-to Tutorials 📑

#### How to find a recipe?

In the app, click the “Search” tab.
In the “Search” bar atop the page, type your search keyword, for example “pasta”.

#### How to view the full recipe with cooking instructions?

With the recipes showing in the “Search” page, choose one and click the *see recipe* button to view the full recipe with its cooking intructions. 
You can return to the search results page by clicking the arrow in top menu or the "Search" tab in the bottom navigation menu.

#### How to add recipe/s to the shopping list?

With the recipes showing in the “Search” page, choose one and click the *cart icon* to add this recipe’s ingredients to the shopping list.
Go back to the “Search” page to find/select another recipe and add it to the shopping list.
You can always view your shopping list in the "List" page.

#### How to view, edit & clear shopping list?

You can check the ingredients you already have by tapping the checkbox next to that ingredient. You can clear the shopping list using the “Clear List” button.

#### How to add a recipe to favourites (starred)?

With the recipes showing in the “Search” page, choose one and click the *star icon* _once_ to add this recipe’s ingredients to the favourites (starred) list. Clicking the star icon for the _second time_ will remove the recipe from the favourites list. 

The presence of the recipe in the starred recipes is indicated by the *star icon* - empty outline means the recipe is not currently in the favourite recipes list, while a full star icon with filling means the recipe is currently added in the favourite recipes list.
You can view your favourite recipes list any time in the “Starred” tab.

#### How to remove a recipe from favourites (starred)?

Go to “Starred” tab to view your favourite recipes list. To remove a recipe from this list, click the star icon.
